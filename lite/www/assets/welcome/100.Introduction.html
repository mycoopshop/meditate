    Welcome to <em>Mindfulness: The Art of Being Human.</em> How are you feeling right now? Excited to try something new? Or maybe just curious to explore?
</p>
<p>
	<strong>What is this?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	This app is the multimedia version of the book <em>Mindfulness: The Art of Being Human</em>. This book is currently only available in this app. Unlike a standard book, this is broken down into bite-sized sections that you can explore at will. It also comes with audio tracks to listen to.
</p>

    Mindfulness is purely an experience. Simply reading the words of a book will never get you to the actual experience of it. This app includes a book on the human mind and behaviour, not also experiential exercises of guided audio tracks and exercises, in order to provide an opportunity to experience mindfulness. 
</p>
<p>	
    <strong>The main part of this app is...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    ...broken down into two main sections: <em>Knowledge</em> (the book) and <em>Experience</em> (the exercises).
<ul>
    <li>	
	<em>Knowledge</em> comprises the complete text of the book. It explores insights into the human mind and patterns of behaviour.
	</li>
    <li>
	<em>Experience</em> is the practical part of the app. It contains a set of guided meditations to practise. It will guide you through some of the concepts and ideas explored in <em>Knowledge</em>.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
	If you simply want to get on with practising mindfulness, then start with the <em>Experience</em> section. 
</p>	
<p>
	If you want to explore the app more thoroughly, you might find that you learn a lot more than you expected. When we have a little insight into the human mind, behaviour and the practice of mindfulness, it can have a powerful effect on helping us live more open, receptive and meaningful lives.
