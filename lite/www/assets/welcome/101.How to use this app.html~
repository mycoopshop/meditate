	<strong>Want a quick start?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here are two suggestions if you want to dive straight into this awesome free app:
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>For a quick start to experince mindfulness</u></em>, practise the <a href="jumplink:21:1">Mindful Check-in (9 mins)</a> section or <a href="jumplink:21:2">Mindfulness of the Breath (10 mins)</a> with your headphones on in a quiet space. Let go of any expectations you may have and allow yourself to experience this.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>For a very brief written overview of mindfulness</u></em> take a look at the text in the <em>Welcome</em> section called <a href="jumplink:1019:4">Mindfulness in a few words</a>. 
</p>
<p>	
	For a written overview of mindfulness go to the <a href="jumplink:31:0">Mindfulness</a> pages at the beginning of the <em>Knowledge</em> section.
</p>
<p>	
	For a more comprehensive written overview of how to practice it with your eyes closed, go to the <a href="jumplink:21:0">How to meditate</a> section.
</p>

    <strong>The main menu</strong>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    You can access the complete content of the app through the white navigation bar at the bottom of this screen. You'll see five icons, one for each section: <em>Welcome</em>, <em>Experience</em>, <em>Knowledge</em>, <em>Challenge</em> and <em>More</em>.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Welcome</em>
</p>
<p>	
    You're in a part of this section now. Welcome is a simple guide on what mindfulness is, how we practise it, and some tips and tools for everyday life.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Experience</em>
</p>
<p>
    This section contains two guided mindfulness audio tracks for you to practise. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triapptech.completemindfulness
">the complete version</a> has the complete set of eight guided mindfulness tracks, as well as extra exercises and tools and summaries of the chapters.
</p>

<button type="button" onclick="parent.location='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triapptech.completemindfulness
'">Take me to it!</button>
</p>
<p>	
	Get your headphones ready. I suggest not using noise-cancelling headphones. Find a peaceful space and give yourself a moment of preparation before pressing play (there are no fast forward or rewind buttons for a reason!).
</p>
<p>
	<em>Knowledge</em>
</p>
<p>
    This section contains a small book called <em>Mindfulness: The Art of Being Human</em>. It provides  insights into the human mind and behaviour. We can all benefit from a little knowledge sometimes. It often helps with our willingness to practise something like this. 
</p>
<p>
	There are also summaries for each of the chapters and some helpful exercises to explore.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Challenge</em>
</p>
<p>
    If you fancy a mindfulness challenge, we have one for you. It starts with just 8 days, for just 10 minutes a day.  
</p>
<p>
	<em>More</em>
</p>
<p>
    This is an extras section. There are links to our online communities, a video, opportunites to sign up or review and more.
</p>
<p>
