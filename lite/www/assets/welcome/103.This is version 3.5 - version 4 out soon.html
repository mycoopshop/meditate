<strong>This is version 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Hey there. If you've had this app for a while, I want to thank you for your patience. This is just a brief message to say that you have part <em>one</em> of a two part update. These two updates are the biggest yet. 
</p>
<p>
	You don't have to do anything but wait for the second part to come to you.   
</p>

    <strong>What's in version 4?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The second part of this major update has the following:
</p>
<p><em>
	- a new complete set of guided audio mindfulness tracks. 
</p>
<p>
	- video content throughout the entire structure of the app to complement both the written text and the guided meditations.
</p>
<p>
	- added extra written text content and images. 
</p>
<p>
	- a range of excercises and tools to use in everyday life situations, with audio and video media to enhance your learning and maximise the experience of mindfulness (paid version only).
</p>
<p>
	- an 8 Day Micro Course on insights into the mind, behaviour and the practice of mindfulness (paid version only).
</p></em>
<p>
	Please contact me with any questions you have about this. Otherwise, I can't wait for you to experience this major update. It's been such a long time coming, but will definitely be worth the wait. Reuben.
