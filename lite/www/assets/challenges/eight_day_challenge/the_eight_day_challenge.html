        Why? Because mindfulness has been shown to benefit people in their learning, concentration, compassion, creativity, and overall psychological well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, brain scans reveal <em>visible</em> changes to the structure of the brain. What's amazing is that these scans were from people who practised for just over <em>20 minutes a day</em> for only eight weeks. These studies at <a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu">Harvard Medical School</a> showed a thickening of the cerebral cortex in areas associated with attention and emotional regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is incredible. Just eight weeks! So, let's play around with the number eight a little. Challenges are often best when taken in smaller steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what about eight <em>days</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The 8 Day (20 Minute) Challenge</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        It can be hard to break out of old habits and maintain new ones, right? Meditating frequently involves practising <em>even</em> when we don’t feel like it. Establishing a habit is fundamental. Tony Schwartz is a well-respected psychologist who found that:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <em>Self-discipline is one way to adhere to a new committed action, but <u>introducing a ritual is far more effective</u>. </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A ritual is simply a set pattern of behaviour regularly performed at around the same time. Why not start your own? It gets easier the more you do it. Applying this to your mindfulness practise is exactly the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's how.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4 steps to the 8 Day Challenge</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        1. First off, let me know by visiting the <em>8 Day Challenge</em> page</a>, and say something like 'Hi Reuben, I'm doing it too'.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <button type="button" onclick="parent.location='http://www.mindfulcreation.com/the-8-day-challenge'">The 8 Day Challenge Page</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Make a ritual. Same time, same place everyday. Be flexible with it, but make a commitment to yourself. It can help to write this down:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>I am committing to the 8 Day Challenge.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to do this at around... (time) every day.
</p>
<p>
    I will practise... (location)</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you think this could be helpful, write this down too:
    </p>
    <p><em>
    I also commit to being flexible with myself. This includes making changes to this plan if necessary, and getting back on track even if I slip up.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Select one of the guided mindfulness audio tracks that are 20 minutes or longer from the <a href="mindfulness:Experience/1">Experience</a> icon. Simply allow yourself to follow the instructions in the guided audio.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Now tell a friend or family member that you're doing this. Science shows that you’re far more likely to commit to a goal if you write it down and, even more so, if you <em>tell someone</em> about it as well. Maybe they may even like to take part.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking forward to <a href="http://www.mindfulcreation.com/the-8-day-challenge">hearing about your experiences</a>. If you contact me here, I'll get in touch with you to see how you're going. Maybe it could even lead on to 8 weeks! Thank you for taking part in this.
    </p>
