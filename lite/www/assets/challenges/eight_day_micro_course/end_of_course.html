As we've explored, it's not just about connecting to the external world. It's so much more than that. It's about how you relate to your inner experiences of body and mind. This inner transformation is an ongoing process. It can only take place with practice.

<p>
Everyone can benefit from insights into the human mind, behaviour and the practice of mindfulness. My hope is that by having completed this micro course, you will have a little more freedom and flexibility in your life.
