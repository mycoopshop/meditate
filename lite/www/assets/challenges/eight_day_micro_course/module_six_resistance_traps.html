<p>
Welcome to your sixth day of this micro course. Please attempt the following:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1) Today's reading</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>This will take approximately 10 minutes.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/3/1/1">What a state!</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/3/1/2">Do you REALLY want to?</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/3/1/4">Chasing the good</a> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>2) Today's formal practice</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>Get your headphones ready.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Experience/1/7">Mindfulness of the Body (18 mins)</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3) Today's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
Why do we get caught up in patterns of behaviour that we don’t really want to be doing sometimes? Not being willing to make space for our undesirable feelings can be the driving force behind the behaviours that don't serve us.
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment A:</em> Notice the little things that you do that don't really serve you. Below are some examples.
</p>
<p>
Do you: <em>comfort eat, over exercise, ruminate, drink too much or take too many drugs, knowingly spend too much, purposefully avoid what could be meaningful encounters?</em>
</p>
<p>
As you become more aware of these patterns, start being mindful of the emotions and urges you are trying to deny by doing these.
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment B:</em> Play with this word: <em>willing.</em> Keep it in mind, particularly for when the urge to act in ways that don't really serve you. If you can catch yourself in those moments, ask yourself: </em>Can I be willing to have these experiences right now?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment C:</em> The power of swapping is huge. For example, instead of thinking to yourself <em>"I must cut down my caffeine intake"</em>, think instead, what can I swap for one of my cups of coffee. And do that. It's all about the baby steps, then add more of the same once your swapping is more of an engrained habit. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- In this context, inner resistance is when we are unwilling to…?
</p>
<p>
- Quick fixes do not always pose a problem to us. They can make us feel better when they are used in…?
</p>
<p>
- The more time we spend doing things to reduce or get rid of our inner experiences what do we miss out on?
</p>
<p>
- What does chasing the good mean? Why can chasing the good cause a problem?
</p>
<p>
- If we can't stop the inner resistance, we can still be willing to have it. How does this make sense to you? What might this be like?
</p>
<p>
- Having completed the <em>Mindfulness of the Body (18 mins)</em> guided meditation, which specific aspects of your body were you more easily drawn to today? Which parts of the body was it not so easy to focus upon? 
</p>
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not being willing to make room for our uncomfortable inner experiences can lead to problems. Unhelpful patterns of behaviour can sometimes take over large parts of our lives. This is important to do because we’re often unaware of this. This isn’t about self-sabotage. It’s about overcoming your conditioning. This is self-growth. Bringing this to your awareness is the first step towards change.
