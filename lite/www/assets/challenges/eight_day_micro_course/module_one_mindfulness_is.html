<strong>3) Today's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mindfulness is about being open and receptive to all your experiences, including what's going on inside of you. Let’s focus upon the external world in this section.  
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<u><em>Experiment A:</em></u> When you’re on the phone, see what it’s like to provide undivided attention to who you’re talking to without doing other things at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<u><em>Experiment B:</em></u> Every morning upon waking, feel the first few breaths.
</p>
<p>
<u><em>Experiment C:</em></u> When in traffic or waiting at a red light, follow your breath for a few minutes to get yourself centred and sharp again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- If you were to explain what mindfulness is to a friend, what would you say? What example can you relate to that you could use?
</p>
<p>
<p>
- When was the formal practice of mindfulness thought to have started?
</p>
</p>
- What is the difference between the original Buddhist teachings about mindfulness compared to the modern Western portrayal of it? <em>(Hint: See the footnote!)</em>
<p>
- In the <em>Mindful Check-in</em> video, what is the core message about when focusing attention upon something?
</p>
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
<p>
The more we practice mindfulness, the more freedom we have in acting in alignment with the things that really matter to us. Without mindfulness, we can easily become distracted from doing these things. The more we do this, the more it strengthens a neural template within our brain which increases our tendency to practice this.
