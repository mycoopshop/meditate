    <p>
        Mindfulness helps with nurturing our intention behind connecting to another person. When we connect in this way it makes our interactions with others more meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Experiment A:</em> Before going into a conversation that could easily be a mindless or automatic chit-chat, take a moment to notice what you’re thinking, feeling and experiencing in the external world. Then gently engage mindfully by either focusing on the sound of the person’s voice, or noticing the subtleties of their facial expressions as they talk to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Experiment B:</em> Upon your return home, give your loved one 5 minutes of your undivided attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Experiment C:</em> The next time someone is talking to you, in person or on the phone, drop a gentle reminder to yourself: <em>What if this was the last time I'm ever going to see this person (because it could be)</em>. Notice any changes in how you interact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Experiment D:</em> Having completed the <em>Mindfulness of the Breath (11 mins)</em> guided meditation, which specific aspect of the breath were you more easily drawn to? At some point today when you feel the need to reconnect, use this specific point of focus as a tool to help keep you grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
    </p>
    <p>
        - With regards to meaningful connection, which life area below could do with a little more of your energy? <em>Choose one out of parent(s), grandparent(s), sibling(s), child(ren), other family, friend(s), and animal(s)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Why do opportunities for meaningful connection often get blocked?
    </p>
    <p>
        - In the <em>Mindfulness of the Breath (11 mins)</em> video, what is a common assumption that people make about practising mindfulness? And, how can this message improve your practice?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>And…</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The more you practice meaningful connection with mindfulness, the more you strengthen the tendency to do so within your brain. This enriches the quality of your life in other areas too.
