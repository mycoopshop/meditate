            <em>Self-discipline is one way to adhere to a new committed action, but introducing a ritual is far more effective. - </em>Tony Schwartz
        </p>
        <p>
            You've been meditating frequently for a few days now. This may have involved practicing even when you didn't feel like it.
        </p>
        <img src="mc.png" alt="Thoughts as Thoughts" width="100%">
        <p>
            What was your practice like? Was it a ritual?
        </p>
        <p>
            A ritual is simply a set pattern of behaviour regularly performed at around the same time. If it was, great. If not, you may want to consider making one. As the quote above suggets, it helps us stay committed to a particular practice that we wish to follow through with.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I say in the <a href="http://www.mindfulcreation.com/the-8-day-challenge">8 Day Challenge</a> page, it’s estimated that by around four weeks of having a new ritual, it can become as natural as the ritual of brushing your teeth, taking a shower or getting dressed.

            And if you wish to, there's more to play with here. Here's three options for you to choose from should they interest you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Option 1:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This option is for those who would like to continue to follow a structure given to them. You are required to continue in a similar way to what you've been doing over these last 8 days, that is doing one formal guided meditation practice and reading 2 sections of <em>Mindfulness: The Art of Being Human</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's face it, you've read a large section of this book already. For this option you simply set yourself the goal to continue:
        </p>
        <p>
            - one guided meditation to practice and
        </p>
        <p>
            - to read just two sections from this app everyday until you've finished them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Option 2:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This option is for those who wish to be creative within the following template:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The things I find I am doing well at are… </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The things I would like to fine tune are…
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to continue my practice by…
        </p>
        <p> <em>
         I plan to review, and if necessary, amend my practice on…</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Option 3:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This option is for those who wish to reconsolidate what they've learnt already.
        </p>
        <p>
            You simply do this <em>8 Day Micro Course</em> again. This means doing the same suggested meditation in part one of each module and reading the same suggested sections in part two again.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this time you can choose different options from part three and four on each day. Part three of each module is a particular life experiement. Part four being questions for reflection. Choose a different one from each section to what you've attempted before.
        </p>
        <p>
            So there you go. If you really want to then here's some options to help you build a ritual so that it comes more and more naturally to you. Thanks so much for taking part in this.
