<em>What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say ‘yes’ to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you. - </em>Eckhart Tolle

Welcome to your final day of this micro course. Please attempt the following:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1) Todays's reading</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>This will take approximately 7 minutes.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/4/3">An art to allowing</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/4/4">Turning towards</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/4/5">Noticing the difference (optional)</a> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>2) Today's formal practice</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>Get your headphones ready.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Experience/1/8">Mindfulness of the body (33 mins)</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3) Today's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are two facets of mindfulness. Conscious awareness is one. The second is the art of allowing. In this context, it is not about accepting things in the external world, but about accepting things in our internal world. This is because it's our inner world that gets affected by our external world.
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment A:</em> The next time you feel fear, anger and frustration. Hold yourself lightly. The more you open to it, the less it will push you around.
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment B:</em> Acknowledge the situations where you can stop the struggle within. When you can't do this, observe the part of you that is resisting. Stay with it for a few moments.
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment C:</em> Come to know that you always have control of your actions, even if your mind says that you don't. Be brave and experiment with something that your mind says you can't or shouldn't do. Choose one task that would give you a sense of meaning that your mind says no to. Notice how your mind can still say no whilst you're actually doing the task.
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment D:</em> Next time somebody says something that pushes your buttons, take a moment to notice the tendency you have to counter-attack. Doing so means you're likely to continue having the same response in future situations. If you can take a moment, ask yourself honestly and openly, <em>What does this situation say about me (instead of them)? What can I learn about myself here, for my own self-growth?</em> Notice the tendency you may have for your mind to stop you from doing this for 'better' reasons! Gently turn towards yourself, notice the aversion, and ask. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- There are two facets to mindfulness. What are they?
</p>
<p>
- Allowing means changing the relationship that we have with our unwanted inner experiences without… <em>(what)</em>?
</p>
<p>
- How do you make sense of <em>turning towards?</em>
</p>
<p>
- What are two out of the four benefits of turing towards our feelings and practicing the art of allowing?
</p>
<p>
- Having completed <em>The Body and Beyond (33 mins)</em> guided meditation, take a moment to congratulate yourself. Wow! 33 minutes. That's great. What was your relationship towards your emotional state in today's practice, compared to yesterday's practice? Doing a comparison of both meditations and their exploration of emotions, which aspects of <em>The Body and Beyond (33 mins)</em> or the <em>Body-Mind-World (23 mins)</em> do you prefer?  
</p>
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
<p>
Turning towards your unwanted inner experiences with open, receptivity is the most powerful tool for self-growth. With this comes less resistance, greater flexibility and more options to choose from as you pave the way for the life you want to have.
