Welcome to your fourth day of this micro course. Please attempt the following:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1) Todays's reading</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>This will take approximately 7 minutes.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/2/2/1">Normal human emotions</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/2/2/2">Good or bad?</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/2/2/3">A beautiful but uncomfortable sunrise (optional)</a> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>2) Today's formal practice</strong> 
</p>
<p>

<strong>3) Todays's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
When we get defensive, emotional discomfort and reactive thoughts get evoked within us. We feel like we’re under threat. The part of our brain that is primitive and reactive takes over. It’s almost always not helpful. But it evolved and worked well for the functions of survival. 
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment A:</em> In the heat of the moment, notice any defensiveness and use this as an opportunity for self-growth. Why? Because it's actually derived from past experiences and not the present moment. Notice how it manifests. Notice your thoughts. Notice your feelings. In doing so, you will find that you can experience the inner discomfort just as an experience, instead of experiencing from the judgements and stories your mind gives you about this as a “wrongdoing”. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment B:</em> Take the time to purposefully find an opportunity to practice being vulnerable or open to your feelings. Do this for the value of your own self-growth. You can then increase the tendency of being more open when you choose to. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment C:</em> Take a moment within your day to distinguish between body, mind and world. Ask yourself <em>What am I feeling in or on my body? What am I noticing in my mind? What am I noticing in the world around me?</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Todays's questions</strong>
</p>
- What are the nine natural emotions that science generally agrees upon?
<p>
Our childhood programming taught us how to manage particular emotions. Considering this, choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- Which emotions were you taught were desirable/undesirable? 
</p>
<p>
- Which ones were you taught to express freely?
</p>
<p>
- Which ones were you taught to supress?
</p>
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
<p>
By noticing and creating a space for defensiveness, we can choose to respond rather than react. This strengthens the tendency for us to be open and receptive to our emotions, instead of closed and rigid. It also strengthens the tendency for us to respond. This means, the more we practice this, the more flexibility we can bring to similar situations in the future.
