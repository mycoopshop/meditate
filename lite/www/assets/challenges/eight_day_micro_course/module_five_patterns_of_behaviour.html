	<em>If you don’t recognise how your fears lead to mindlessness, you’ll tend to look to events, others, and your past and future for explanations of your suffering, which can lead to a great deal of blaming, compensating, controlling, manipulating, and avoiding. - </em>Thomas Roberts

<strong>3) Today's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re talking about patterns of behaviour. We all have patterns of behaviour with varying degrees of frequency. Some are important to come to know. Some are helpful. They move us towards a meaningful life. Some are not. They steer us away from a meaningful life.
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment A:</em> Reflect upon some of the little patterns of behaviour you do that don't really serve you. Make a little list of some of the ones you would like to change. When you find yourself doing them, see if you can do them mindfully, instead of mindlessly. That's it. Don't even think about changing them yet. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment B:</em> Make it a habit to notice the difference between what your mind tells you (instant gratification is good) and what your experience of life tells you (instant gratification isn't always helpful). Ask yourself in the moment: <em>Right now, this is what my mind is saying, but what does my experience tell me?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment C:</em> Notice which situations trigger emotional discomfort, whether it’s among certain family members, friends or particular environments. You'll feel more rigid, controlling and unaccepting of others. Work with the situations that cause a subtle reaction within you. Start by simply becoming aware, and if you can, take some gentle curiosity to yourself. As you do this, you’ll notice how there's an option to be more fluid, flexible and accepting of how you feel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- In the <em>The little patterns - part one</em> section it states that we tend to get stuck in the same unhelpful patterns of behaviour even when we don't like them. How do you make sense of this?
</p>
<p>
- Complete the sentence: <em>We often choose feeling better as a comfortable compromise over…</em>
</p>
<p>
- In <em>The little patterns - part two</em> section at the very top it gives example of patterns of behaviour in relationships. What patterns of behaviour are you aware of yourself? 
</p>
<p>
- In which environments and situations does this life belong to you? And which environments and situations are you overly influenced by your thoughts and feelings?
</p>
- Having completed the <em>The Breath and Beyond (22 mins)</em> guided meditation, which specific aspect of the breath were you more easily drawn to today? Was it the same as your experience before on Module 2? Could this be an anchor for you when you notice the urge to get caught up in a meaningless pattern of behaviour?
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
Becoming more aware of your patterns of behaviour is important. This is about overcoming your conditioning. It's self-growth. Bringing this to your awareness is the first step towards change.
<p>
Mindfulness opens the capacity within us for getting unstuck from these unhelpful little patterns of behaviour because it makes space for our emotions and this changes the relationship we have to them.
