	Hi, I'm Reuben.	I'm the founder of <em>Mindful Creation</em> and the co-founder of a charity called <em>ACT on it</em>. I also work in mental health, specialising in addictions, at a health clinic in Melbourne, Australia.  
</p>
<p>
	Much of my work is influenced by contextual psychology. Within this field, I specialise in Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT). I am also influenced by non-denominational spiritual approaches, including Buddhist psychology. These type of approaches don't tell you what to believe. They're about empowering you to live the life you want to live. They acknowledge the shortfalls of the human mind and they know that humans are essentially loving.

	When you unpack these approaches, they all seem to come down to self-awareness, compassion and love. I've found that the more I connect with them, the more my life has improved. 
</p>
<p>
	I'm really passionate about this. Since I've been practising mindfulness, I've really noticed the difference in my life, as well as the difference it makes in the lives of my friends and clients. This is the reason why I created this app.

<b>My story</b>
</p>
<p>
	When I was 13, I got the worst report in my school for bad behaviour. 
</p>
<p>
    This isn't what you'd expect from someone who is into mindfulness, is it?
