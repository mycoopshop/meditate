	Okay. Let's make this simple. The more mindful we are of our thoughts and feelings, the more freedom we have in acting in alignment with the things that really matter to us. This is because it's our thoughts and feelings that can turn us away from doing things that really matter. So, mindfulness is about making a conscious change to disengage from things that don't help us move forward, and this of course includes some of our thoughts and feelings.
</p>
<p>
    But what is mindfulness?

	Mindfulness is about being open and receptive to all your experiences, including what's going on inside of you. You'll take less interest in your thoughts, <em>unless</em> they’re helpful. It’s about getting out of your mind and into your life.
</p>
<p>
    What’s fascinating is that in recent years, neuroscience has shown that mindfulness makes <em>visible</em> changes to the structure of your brain. Certain areas actually appear thicker in brain scans.
</p>
<p> 
    There are also well over 2,000 research studies demonstrating how effective it is. It’s been shown to benefit those who suffer from chronic pain, to help reduce stress, to strengthen the immune system, to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and to help people lead happier and more purposeful lives.

<p>
    Many of these scientific studies were of people who practised for just 20 minutes daily. The guided meditations within the free app are shorter than this, but still a great stepping stone towards longer meditations of around 20-30 minutes which are in the paid app. Even if you are choosing to just use the shorter meditations in the free app, there have still been benefits shown in practicing for a few minutes a day. Go with what you're intuition says about what you want to practice. They're are no rules to this.

    I hope you enjoy this app. Let's start the journey right now. We'll come to explore the human mind and behaviour, and of course the practice of mindfulness. In doing so, you can use it as an avenue to go beyond the mind and into the experience of simply <em>being</em>.
