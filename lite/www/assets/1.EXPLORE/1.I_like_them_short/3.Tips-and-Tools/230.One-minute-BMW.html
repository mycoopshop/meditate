    This exercise has three phases of around 20 seconds each. You don’t have to be concerned with their exact length.
</p>
<p>
    Body
</p>
<p>
    <em>For around 20 seconds, bring your awareness your body. This can be anywhere within your body. It could be the sensations upon or within your body. Notice which felt sense experience you are more easily drawn to and use this as your point of connection, your anchor in this moment. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Mind
</p>
<p>
    <em>Turn your attention towards your mind for 20 seconds. Close your eyes and notice what you can see from behind your eyes. Watch and wait for thoughts to appear as you do this. Let these thinking patterns do what they will. </em>
</p>
<p>
    World
</p>
<p>
    <em>For the next 20 seconds, focus your attention upon the external world as you open your eyes.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Notice 3 things that you can see. Focus attention on purpose by taking a curious look as though you’re looking for the first time at these things.</em>
</p>
<p>
	Play with this exercise and fine tune it so that it works better for you.
