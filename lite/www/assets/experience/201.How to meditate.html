    Have you been told that meditation is about not thinking anything?
</p>
<p>
    I had. I remember hearing about meditation when I was younger, and trying hard not to think anything at all for a few seconds. I failed and then didn't try again for another 20 years! The truth is that absolute mental silence is not the goal.

    Meditation is actually far more simple than most people think.

    <i>Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different.</i> - James Baraz

    Below is an acronym that you may find helpful. This is how to practise <em>formally </em>with the audio recordings in this app. You don't have to use it; it simply offers some direction and structure if you prefer. 
</p>
<p>
    Use it as you wish and only if it helps.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>S</h2>
    <strong>pace</strong>
    – Start by finding a quiet space where you can practise. Ideally find a place where you won’t be disturbed. Minimise distracting noises. Turn your phone to silent or set it to airplane mode.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>P</h2>
    <strong>osture</strong>
    – Find a posture that embodies comfort, alertness and relaxation. You can either sit comfortably or lie down. Remember though, mindfulness is about a state of wakefulness! Once comfortable, see if you can keep your posture for the entire practice. Close your eyes if you wish to; however, you may prefer to hold a soft gaze at something in front of you.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>A</h2>
    <strong>llow</strong>
    – The art of allowing involves a gentle resilience to all of the tempting distractions that arise. Urges to move or fidget will keep your mind active if you continually give in to them. This defeats the purpose. It's normal to have a few minutes of discontent until you settle. Allow yourself to <em>be</em>, letting thoughts and feelings come and go, and remain open to any experience you encounter.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>C</h2>
    <strong>onscious Intent</strong>
    –<strong> </strong>Another word of descrbing this could be <em>focused awareness</em>. This therefore involves <em>intention</em> and <em>attention</em>. Focused awareness involves a delicate yet alert focus. It requires a gentle noticing for when your attention wanders. Attention is like a toddler first learning to walk. It moves from place to place with no agenda. Once you notice this wandering, gently refocus again each time, and again, and again …
</p>
<p>
    <h2>E</h2>
    <strong>nding</strong>
    – You will be guided towards the end of the meditation in this app. Take a few moments to observe your experience. Know that with practice, you can bring the same quality of mindfulness to everyday activities with a simple shift of awareness.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes people tell me they feel worse when practising mindfulness. This can be common in the beginning. Mindfulness increases our awareness and opens us to being more receptive to everything. This means being more aware of all things pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. Increasing awareness of any aspect of our lives is actually waking up to the reality of what it is. This is progress.
