  <li>Get your headphones ready.</li>
  <li>Find a quiet space.</li>
  <li>Give yourself a moment of preparation before pressing play (there are no fast forward or rewind buttons for a reason!).</li>

	The <em>Mindful Check-In</em> is a great little exercise for anyone who wants to reconnect. It’s also for those days when you’ve only got a few minutes. Because of this you can treat it like a check-in service.

	The quote below highlights the essence of mindfulness.</p>
<p align="center">
	<i>Meditation is at its most potent when you have no expectation, when you're open to everything, and when you maintain an attitude of naïve fascination.</i> - Paul Wilson
</p>
<p>
	Be kind to yourself when starting with this. It’s easy to buy into expectations and, in doing so, set yourself up with an agenda. The problem is that when things don’t go as expected, it’s easy to become frustrated. Let go of any expectations and allow yourself to have whatever experience that arises. This isn’t about success or failure. It’s an ongoing practice.
