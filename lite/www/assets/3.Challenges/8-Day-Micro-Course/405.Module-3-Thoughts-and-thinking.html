<strong>3) Todays's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
As we’ve covered in this section, automatic thinking in often unnecessary and unhelpful. Even so, we have an automatic tendency to give too much energy to our thoughts which keeps them in momentum. When we are up in our minds, we’re not in the present moment. 
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment A:</em> Start noticing just how much of a problem-finding machine your mind is! Notice the negative bias that it casts upon situations. Know this is normal, and with this, you have a choice as to whether you buy into these thoughts or not.
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment B:</em> When you find your mind churning out unhelpful thoughts, do the following:
</p>
<p>
- Take a few mindful breaths and allow your thoughts to be just thoughts for a few seconds. 
</p>
- Notice their form; whether they’re like images or an audio recording. 
<p>
</p>
- Then take a moment to use your mind and be grateful for some of the amazing thoughts it has given you in the past.
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment C:</em> Or, when you find your mind churning out an unhelpful thought, mentally state the following sentence and put the thought after it:
</p>
<p>
<em>I am noticing the thought that…</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment D:</em> Become familiar with the theme of the thinking patterns your mind gives you at a particular point in the day. When you are aware of such a theme, start to label this when it occurs. When you’ve done this remember to gently return your focus upon what you were doing. (For further information on this click this <a href="mindfulness:Experience/2/13">Labelling</a> link)
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- Within the <em>"What is my mind?"</em> section above, there are two brief accounts of what a mind is. From the perspective taken within this app, how would you describe what a mind actually is to someone? 
</p>
<p>
- What's the average ratio of negative bias for a human mind? <em>(If this interests you, you may like to recall "80% and 80%" or "80-80" to help you remember.)</em>
</p>
<p>
- Within the <em>"Thought upon thought"</em> section above, it states that our minds are excellent <em>problem-solvers</em>. But minds don't solve the problem of unwanted thoughts for two reasons. What are these two reasons?
</p>
<p>
- Complete the sentence: <em>Our minds judge and evaluate anything and everything, including…</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
<p>
The more we practice noticing our thoughts, the more we <em>look at</em> them instead of <em>from them</em>. This increases our tendency to be resilient to all sorts of distractions, unhelpful thoughts included. And the more we do this we realise the random and arbitrary nature of thoughts, and how the intelligence of who we are is far superior than what most of our automatic thoughts tell us.
