    Mindfulness is the art of observing our body-mind-world experiences with open receptivity as they arise. It helps us <em>simply be</em> with <em>what is</em>, without becoming too attached to <em>or</em> rejecting the given experience.

    <i>Nothing is worth more than this day.</i> - Johann Goethe
</p>
<p>
    If mindfulness could be broken down into a few simple words, it might look like this:
</p>
<p>
    <em>Conscious intent …</em> 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Allowing …</em>
</p>
<p>
    To explain that a little further, let's use an example …
</p>
<p>
    You know what it’s like to pat a dog. You may find yourself doing it automatically. For example, you could be having a conversation with a friend and simply find yourself stroking him. Then there are times when you feel obliged to pat the dog because of his nudges, pokes and the eyes he gives you. 
</p>
<p>	
	But there are also occasions when you’ll stroke him deliberately, simply for the sake of enjoying the connection. This simply means that you are fully connected to him, on <em>purpose</em>. Focusing in this way means you have <em>intention</em> behind your awareness. <em>Conscious intent.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Now imagine that he rubs his wet nose onto your clean hand. Yuck! And imagine you notice an urge to pull away, but you don’t because you want to connect with him. You want to connect in this way because you value the relationship you have with him. You <em>accept</em> what is. You’re aware, open and <em>receptive</em> to this experience, slimy hand included! You’re aware, open and receptive to what is. <em>Allowing.</em>

    But enhancing your connection isn't the only thing that mindfulness is beneficial for. It's also a great way to slow down and appreciate the connections we make in life. The following parable explores this.
</p>

    <i><b>A Parable on Modern Life</b></i>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>The animals met in assembly and began to complain that humans were always taking things away from them.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>‘They take my milk’, said the cow.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>‘They take my eggs’, said the hen.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>‘They took my brother’s flesh for bacon’, said the hog.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>‘They hunted my mother for her oil’, said the whale.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>The snail was the last to speak. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>
    'I have something they would certainly take away from me if they could. Something that deep down they seem to be missing, more than anything else … I have time.'
    </em>
</p>

    This parable highlights the fast-paced nature of what it’s like to be human; absorbed in thoughts about getting somewhere else in the <em>future</em> or consumed in thoughts about the <em>past</em>. None of which are ever here right now. As we’ll come to find, it’s absolutely normal for our minds to sabotage meaningful life experiences and pull us into doing other things instead. And yet, we’ve got plenty of time if we step out of our minds and into the richness of life in the present.
