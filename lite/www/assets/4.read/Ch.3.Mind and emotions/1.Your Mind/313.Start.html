    Your mind is like my mind, and we’re both addicted to thinking…
</p>
<p>
	Does that seem a bit far-fetched?
</p>
<p>
    Allow yourself to reflect on this...
</p>
<p>
    What’s going on for you right now? Whatever thoughts you have, are you willing to allow your mind to do what it will, and gently refocus your attention upon these words? There’s an art to this, but it definitely gets easier the more we do it.
</p>
<p>
    <i>There are my thoughts… and here I am…</i>
</p>
<p>
    It can be helpful to have a little insight into the human mind. It's normal to think that we know ourselves well enough. But because we are mostly absorbed in the content of our thoughts we have a tendency to take our thoughts more seriously than necessary.
