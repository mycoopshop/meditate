	Like mindfulness, neuroscience (brain science) is becoming a bit of a buzz word. This is because of its massive advances in recent years. Scientists used to believe that the human brain did <em>not</em> change after it reached adulthood. Now they've found that this could not be further from the truth! Our brains are constantly changing and growing.
</p>
<p>
	Neuroscience is all about the neurons within our brains. Neurons are nerve cells that communicate with each other. Every human brain has around 100 billion. Depending on what we feel, think, experience, and how we behave, certain neurons get stimulated as they connect with each other. As we do this it creates different 'templates' of neural pathways. The more these neural templates are used, the thicker the pathways get.

<p>
	So if you start playing the piano, you're creating a neural template to do so. The more you practice this, the thicker the neural template gets.
</p>
<p>
	This is fascinating because this strengthening of neural pathways is how the brain changes and actually <em>grows</em> in particular areas. This growing of the brain has been termed neuroplasticity. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Neuroplasticity? So what?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    So, how does all this fit in with what we've been talking about, like quick-fix strategies? Well our brains adapt to the behaviours we do. As we do this, the associated neural template for a behaviour is strengthened. 
</p>
<p>	
	<em>This strengthening applies to <u>anything</u> we do - whether it's in our best interest or not. </em>
</p>
<p>	
	This is good news for you. Why? Because this means that you can strengthen the neural templates within your brain for taking action towards things that are meaningful, instead of meaningless. And in doing so, you are changing your brain to grow and adapt towards patterns of behaviour that serve you.
</p>
<p>	
	By practicing mindfulness, we make space for distracting thoughts, feelings and urges, instead of being controlled by them. Every time you practise the guided meditations within this app you are strengthening a neural template of gentle resilience within your brain, <em>away</em> from distractions and <em>towards</em> the things that are meaningful to you.
