<p>
    - Life can become a game of escaping from our unwanted inner experiences, and feeling better temporarily.
</p>
<p>
    - When our direct experience tells us that the patterns of behaviour we’re doing don’t work for us, our minds will be there to say that they do.
</p>
<p>
    - Sometimes we’re very aware of our feelings, and yet unaware of the patterns of this trap. And vice versa: sometimes we’re aware of the patterns, and unaware of the struggle with our feelings. This is a trap, but there is a way out. 
</p>
<p> 
    - Mindfulness helps us become more aware of both our feelings and our unhelpful patterns of behaviour. It gives us the flexibility to break free from these cycles.
