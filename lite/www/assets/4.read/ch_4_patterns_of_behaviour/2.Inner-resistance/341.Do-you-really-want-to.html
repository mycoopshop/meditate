    Whenever we’re in a state of resistance, we have a tendency to do things to make us feel better. When we're in a state of mild inner resistance, it can present as an urge to be elsewhere. We don't open up and settle into the moment. We aren't as receptive to those around us. As we covered before with <a href="mindfulness-section:Knowledge/3/0">The little patterns</a>, when used in <em>moderation,</em> these coping strategies can give us a sense of inner ease. However, there can be a trap in this 'feeling better' game, particularly when it invloves doing things we don't really want to. 
</p>
<p>
    So why would we actually do things that we may not <em>really</em> want to be doing? This is a great question, and yet we often fall short in giving ourselves an answer. Instead, our minds tend to justify our actions when we're doing something primarily to <em>feel better</em>. This is also the case even when our actions are ones we later regret. Take the example of somebody who wants to quit smoking. Deep down this person may <em>really</em> want to quit. But when it comes round to the discomfort of cravings, having another cigarette is justified in one way or another. It feels better.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a list of things that we may be inclined to do to distract ourselves from thinking or feeling a certain way. You may like to check with your own experience here to see if you can relate to similar things that you’ve done. And just a reminder, these are things that we all may do from time to time.
</p>
<p><em>
    Distractions like eating, drinking, taking substances etc.
</p>
<p>
    Having a good old gossip.
</p>
<p>
    Ploughing into work.
</p>
<p>
    Doing things to please or impress others.
</p>
<p>
    Avoiding people, places and things you value (not doing something is still a behaviour!)
</p>
<p>
    Indulging in shopping therapy.
</p>
<p>
    Internet surfing, Facebook, watching the television and so on.
</p></em>
<p>
    Now consider:
</p>
<p> 
	1) If you spend a lot of time doing these activities, as a way of distracting yourself from your inner experiences, is it possible that these strategies could get in the way of other meaningful areas of your life? <br><em>Maybe consider your time, energy, finances, physical health, mental well-being and your connection with others.</em>
</p>
<p>
	2) Although these strategies can make us feel better in the <em>short-term</em>, when you use them, do they get rid of <em>your</em> inner experiences in the <em>long-term</em>?
