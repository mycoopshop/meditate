    Acceptance is the art of allowing our inner experiences to be. This doesn’t imply a liking or a wanting of them, but rather a letting be. Sometimes we can’t stop the inner resistance that we’re experiencing, and that's okay. Why? Because it's a normal human experience to resist unwanted feelings.
