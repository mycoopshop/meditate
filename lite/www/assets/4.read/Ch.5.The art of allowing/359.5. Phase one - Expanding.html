    <strong>Phase one - Expanding</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    Expanding means <u>changing the relationship</u> that we have with our unwanted inner experiences <u>without</u> changing the experiences themselves.</em>
</p>
<p>
    So in the context of unwanted feelings, this is <em>never</em> about trying to change them. It’s about the <em>relationship</em> we have to them. This is based on the fact that whenever we resist our unwanted inner experiences, we give them more power. 
</p>
<p>
    I just said fact then, didn’t I? 
</p>
<p>
    That’s a typo! Don't take what I’m saying here as fact. Always check in with your experience with life first. This is where your truth is. Anyway, let's get back to this. 
</p>
<p>
    Maybe recall a time when you had an unwanted feeling and you <em>really</em> wanted it to go away. Anxiety is always a good example for this. What happens when you resist anxiety? It doesn't go away and it can get worse, right? The inner struggle with this feeling makes it a bigger problem. So what can we do about this inner resistance?

<i>
    Non-resistance is the key to the greatest power in the universe. Through it, consciousness is freed from its imprisonment.</i> - Eckhart Tolle</center>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. Go on Eckhart! This quote may sound a little out there. But in this context, it can simply mean that inner resistance <em>imprisons</em> us. Why? Because we're caught up in a <em>struggle</em>. And this, of course, can include our unwanted feelings like anxiety. Through non-resistance, they can be free to be. They might not be exactly as we’d prefer, but we can make space for the discomfort. In doing so, we not only take responsibility for our feelings, but we begin the process of transforming our inner world. I'm not exaggerating here. This is exactly what happens with practice. And the more we do this, the more likely we are to appreciate this freedom and flexibility.
