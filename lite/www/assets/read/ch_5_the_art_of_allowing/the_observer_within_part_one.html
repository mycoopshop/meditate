    <strong>The Observer Within - part one</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You know those moments when you just want to find a quiet space? Instead of being part of something, sometimes we prefer to distance ourselves, move away, or maybe even just watch what's going on instead of being involved in it. 
</p>
<p>
	The Observer Within us is the part of us that we rarely take the time to use in this busy world of doing. So, what is this then? Let's use an example. The Observer Within can be likened to a painting. The picture itself is all the experiences we have. These include our thoughts, beliefs, values, feelings, intuitions and more. But none of this would be possible if we didn’t have the capacity for awareness.
</p>
<p>
    The canvas on which this is painted is our awareness. This is like the Observer Within. An infinite variety of pictures can be painted depending on our life experiences. Whatever the pictures, they all share the fact that they’re painted on a canvas. Without the canvas there would be no painting. Without the Observer Within, there would be no body, mind, and world experiences.
</p>
<p>
	Mindfulness isn't possible without the observer within us. When in touch with this part of you, this statement is true:
</p>
<p>	
<em>You are <u>not</u> your thoughts, emotions, sensations or urges.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The more we practice mindfulness, the more we come to recognise this for when it's helpful. 
</p>
<p>	
	Your thoughts, emotions, sensations, and urges are always changing. They are not who you are. The observer within is the part of you that watches everything. This part of you is calm. It observes with interest. It doesn’t judge or get involved with what’s going on, but watches and makes room for all of the experiences you have as they come and go, regardless of their nature. It can’t be hurt or affected in any way because it simply observes.
