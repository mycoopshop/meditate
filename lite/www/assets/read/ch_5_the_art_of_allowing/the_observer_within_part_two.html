    <strong>The Observer Within - part two</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The observer within observes thoughts <em>as</em> thoughts and remains the observer. It observes emotions, sensations and urges simply <em>as</em> emotions, sensations and urges. It experiences all things directly, without any added reaction added. 
</p>
<p align="center">
    <i>Truth has nothing to do with words.</i> - Hui Neng	
</p>
<p>	
	This part of you observes everything with openness and interest. As the quote above suggests, it witnesses the truth of everything by looking at all experiences. And words in our minds are just thoughts. When we step back as the observer, we become aware of ourselves noticing. This Observer Within is pure awareness. Pure awareness simply <em>is.</em> This is your truth.
</p>
<p>
    This is an exercise to get you in touch with the Observer Within. As we’ve explored, this is something that can only be experienced and never understood. Give yourself at least 10 seconds for each of the sentences. Don’t count! Thinking interferes with the exercise. It’s a rough guide. Ideally if somebody can talk you through it, that would be great.

    <em>
    Recall a pleasant memory from your early childhood.
</p>
<p> 
    Allow yourself to remember what you were doing at this particular time in your past.
</p>
<p> 
    Relive this memory for a few moments, remembering what you could see, hear, touch and smell.
</p>
<p> 
	As you do this, see if you can connect to a sense of observing the world from behind your eyes … as you were then.
</p> 
<p> 
    Within this memory, notice who was aware of those events as they were unfolding.
</p>
<p>
    Now recall a simple memory from yesterday morning.
</p>
<p> 
    Relive this event for a few moments.
</p> 
<p>
    Remember what you could see, hear, touch and smell.
</p>
<p>
    See if you can connect to this event as it was while it was happening.
</p>
<p> 
    Notice, within this memory, who was aware of this experience then and there.
</p>
<p> 
    See if you can connect with a sense of looking out from behind your eyes.
</p>
<p> 
    Become aware of the person who is tentatively following these words simply to connect with themselves.
</p>
<p> 
    You are the witness to these experiences.
</p>
<p> 
    You always have been.
</p>
<p> 
    Notice that you are here now, and notice too that the same person reading now, was there yesterday, and was there as a child.
</p>
<p> 
    You have always been you; yet, your mind, body, and the external world have changed; sometimes rapidly, and sometimes slowly.
</p>
<p> 
    This I can never be manipulated or hurt in anyway. It is the witness to this.
</p>
<p> 
    This I is pure awareness.
</p>
<p> 
    I am.
</em>
</p>
<p>
    We often don't take the opportunity to step back and into the Observer Within. This is where we can connect to what is <em>really</em> going on. This state of being is available to us whenever we choose it. Our minds will of course hijack this process again and again. That's what they're designed to do. Coming to know that this is normal helps us to step back and even to stop us wasting our energy on unecessary thinking.
