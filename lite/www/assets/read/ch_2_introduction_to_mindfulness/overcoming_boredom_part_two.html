<p>
    There’s a common illusion here. We get hooked into believing that it’s our external world that we don't like. This sounds straightforward, right? However, it’s never the case. 
</p>
<p>
<em>
    It’s our <u>internal reaction</u> to any situation we think we don’t like, <u>never</u> the situation itself.
</em> 
</p>
<p>
    This means it’s actually the unwanted thoughts and feelings that are evoked within us that we don't like, not the actual situation. So, with regards to thoughts about boredom, what would it be like to <em>not</em> invest in these? We would be in contact with the situation, instead of our thoughts about the situation. There would be no boredom. No need for resentment. 
</p>
<p>
	Here's three insights into boredom that can help us lose the grip we place upon it:
</p><em>
<p>	
	1) Neuroplasticity - the more time we invest in boredom, the stronger we create the boredom learning template within our brains. Basically, the more we practice being bored the better we get at being bored.
</p>
<p>
	2) It's never the situation that we don't like, it's our thoughts and feelings about it. In fact, it’s our <u>internal reaction</u> to any situation we think we don’t like, <u>never</u> the situation itself.
</p>
<p>
	3) There is a way out of boredom - it doesn't simply have to pass.
</p>
<p></em>
    To break out of the cage of boredom, taking as much presence out of your surroundings as possible is one approach. However, sometimes it can be worth bringing some curiosity to which aspects of your here and now experience you find more easily drawn to. 
<em></p>
<p>
    This involves using some or all of your five senses.
</p>
<p>
    Notice the initial thoughts you have about your environment. Let them be.
</p>
<p>
    No need to provide them with energy.
</p>
<p>
    Refocus on the now.
</p>
<p>
    If necessary, label the thoughts and feelings that are hijacking your moment of now.
</p>
<p>
    And then, again, bringing deliberate attention to one of some of the five senses as you return to the here and now once more.</em>
