	<strong>INNER RESISTANCE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="video:NO VIDEO HERE ON PURPOSE"><img src="Play_button_2.jpg" alt="Tap Me!" width="100%"></a>
</p>
<p> 
   Let’s be clear here. In this context, resistance is a state of our <em>inner world</em>. It presents as an inner unrest or struggle. It's when we're <em>unwilling</em> to have our inner experiences, such as thoughts, feelings and urges. We all experience the tendency to try to avoid these unwanted experiences sometimes. 
</p>
<p>
<em> 
   When we’re <u>unwilling</u> to experience our thoughts and feelings it causes a <u>struggle</u> within us, no matter how severe or subtle this may be. </em>
</p>
<p>   
   Only you will know whether you're willing or unwilling to experience certain feelings or not. This is because only you can experience yours. But you'll sometimes have to tune into yourself on the inside to find out.
</p>
<p>
   Mindfulness helps us here. It takes us to the direct experience of what is <em>really</em> going on. The more we practise mindfulness, the more <em>open</em> and <em>receptive</em> we become; the more attuned we can be to <em>how</em> we resist our inner experiences.
</p>
<p>
   This means there's huge potential here for self-growth and change if you want it. Why? Because in becoming more aware of these experiences, you notice them for <em>what</em> they are, which is not <em>who</em> you are. In doing this, we actually change the relationship we have with them. This gives us much more freedom in life. We'll explore this in an upcoming chapter, <a href="mindfulness-section:Knowledge/4">The art of allowing</a>.
</p>
<p>
   What we'll move on to explore in the next section is how this plays out in many aspects of our lives and sometimes we're not even aware of it.
