	<strong>THE FEELING GOOD TRAP - PART ONE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="video:NO VIDEO HERE ON PURPOSE"><img src="Play_button_2.jpg" alt="Tap Me!" width="100%"></a>
</p>
<p> 
    Contrary to what many of us may think, clinging onto or chasing desirable feelings like happiness can cause us to struggle in life. Why?  Like all pleasant feelings, happiness comes and goes. It never stays. 
</p>
<p> 
    In this context, chasing the good means we hold on <em>tightly</em> to happiness. It sounds logical though doesn't it? Happiness brings us pleasant feelings afterall. But a problem automatically arises when we do this. It means we have a strong tendency to resist the other feelings that aren’t so pleasant. This is because when we cling on <em>tightly</em> to feeling happy or good, it becomes the main agenda over everything else. 
</p>
<p>	
	The feel-good messages in our societies don't help. 'Don’t worry be happy,' 'happiness is a choice' and 'think happy and be happy' are some of the many messages that we're programmed to believe. These themes often reinforce for us that feeling good or being happy is the <em>only</em> way, or how we <em>should</em> feel. This can cause a problem. It means that feeling any other uncomfortable feelings is not how things should be. And as we've covered in the previous section, this can lead to all sorts of unhelpful behaviours.
