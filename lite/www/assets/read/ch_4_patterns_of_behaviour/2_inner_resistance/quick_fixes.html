    They’re quick fixes, right? When we use them, we reward ourselves. They feel better <em>only</em> in the short-term. In the long-term, we can sometimes feel worse.
</p>
<p>
    We all have strategies to reduce our unwanted feelings. But we <em>can't</em> get rid of them forever. I really want to emphasise a point here. It's not that using these strategies is bad. If they help you feel better, then it can be absolutely fine - but only in <em>moderation</em>. This is essential to know. Only when we use them to excess do we teach ourselves to do even more of them in the long-term. 
</p>
<p>	
	And a really important point to emphasise here is:
</p>
<p>
    <em>
    The <u>more</u> time we spend doing things to get rid of or reduce our unwanted experiences, the <u>less</u> time we spend doing things that <u>truly</u> matter to us.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Tying all this together can look a little bit like this:
</p>
<p>
<em>
    Q: What happens when we’re in a state of unrest? <br>
    A: Inner resistance builds. 
</p>
<p>
    Q: What do we have a tendency to do when we’re in a state of inner resistance? <br>
    A: We do more things that are not helpful to us, moving us away from the life we want to be living.
</p>
<p>
    Q: What’s it like when we’re not fully living a life that we want to be living? <br>
    A: It can give us a feeling of unrest within. 	
	</em> 
</p>
<p>
    The cycle completes once more.
</p>
<p>
    The sentences above highlight the process of an inner resistance trap. Life becomes a game of escaping from ourselves and feeling better, but only temporarily. Now let's look at how this plays out for us in sometimes the most subtle and insidious ways.
