	<strong>FEAR</strong>
</p>

    This quote by Plato is worth considering.

	It’s how we manage some of our normal emotions that cause arguments, violence and battles between individuals, cultures and nations.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s take a look at one more human emotion to highlight this. 
</p>
<p>
    <em>Fear</em> 
</p>
<p>
    Fear is normal. It provides a sense of caution needed for our survival. However…
</p>
<p>
    <em>To be <u>unwilling</u> to experience fear causes <u>resistance</u> which distorts it. </em>
</p>
    In fact, being unwilling to experience any of our feelings causes resistance. But your experience of what you've noticed about your unwanted feelings is going to be your best teacher. It may resonate with what I’m saying here, and sometimes maybe not. 
</p>
<p>	
	Let's use an example.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine Cuthbert has a fear of dogs. (Sorry, that name just randomly popped into my head. It's a fictional name from a comic book I read as a kid! The more I say it, the more I'm getting into it). Cuthbert does all the right things (as far as his mind is concerned) to avoid any possible experience with dogs. This involves not going to the houses of good friends, avoiding walks in the park which he enjoys, and a range of other steps to make sure he doesn't meet <em>any</em> dogs.
</p>
<p>
    Do you think Cuthbert's fear will diminish from his actions in avoiding dogs at all costs? 
</p>
<p>
    What does your experience of feeling anxious tell you about what Cuthbert fears? 
</p>
<p>
    It's likely to stick around, or maybe get even <em>worse</em>, right? 
</p>
<p>
	Isn't this interesting? On one hand your experience of life may tell you that if you try <em>hard</em> to avoid or resist your feelinngs of fear then it comes back stronger. And on the other hand, your mind will often tell you (in the heat of the moment) that you should try hard to get rid of this feeling.
</p>
<p>	
	So, as crazy as it may sound, our minds our not often our friends! Science shows this, as we've covered. Reflecting on what our past experience tells us about fear is often more helpful than what our minds tell us in the heat of the moment.
