	Please will you help me share my passion? People need this. 
</p>	
<p>	
	I made this app purely to go a little deeper than a simple introduction to mindfulness and how to connect to the external world. I made this because it's an excellent way of reaching out to people with an important message: 
</p>
<p><em>	
	You are normal. Your thoughts and feelings are normal.  
</em></p>
<p>
    It's my guess that there's someone you know right now that could do with something like this. It doesn't matter what direction we look in. There they are. There you are. Here I am.

    By reviewing this app you are giving it more recognition in the app stores. It only takes 30 seconds. This means that more people can benefit from it. I can also continue to develop further resources for you. 	
</p>
<p>	
	If you think this could make a positive difference in somebody's life, or maybe it could make a difference in yours, could you do me a favour?
