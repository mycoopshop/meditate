<strong>Thank you!</strong>

To my family who love me and allow me to be me.

To my friends near and very far. I'm so grateful for your support over the last two years.

Kim, what an amazing friendship and working relationship we have formed. Mindful Creation wouldn't be the same without you.

Dearest Chris and Gill(ian)! You know who you are. But you remember it too, frequently. Words will never do justice for my gratitude to you both. Thank you from the bottom (and top) of my heart.

To my two nephews and beautiful niece, Raffy, Zephan and Dilly. Just for the sake of it. I love you. You aren't even old enough to comprehend the amazing change that's taking place in this world as yet, but I've no doubt you'll be part of it.
