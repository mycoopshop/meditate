    This is about turning <em>towards </em>some of the experiences you would normally turn <em>away</em> from. It's about being a little more flexible with how you relate to yourself. In this case, it can simply mean observing with kind awareness the resistance that you’re feeling, so as not to become consumed in it.

   <i>Self-awareness is an act of self-kindness.</i>
  </p>	
<p>	
	Even if observing is all you can do in that moment, that’s okay. While you observe it, you’re not identified with it. You're <em>not</em> feeding it. This is an act of self-kindness, <em>even</em> if it doesn’t feel like it.
</p>
<p>
    If we don't notice and tune into ourselves, we can be entangled with inner resistance and even unaware of it. Without this awareness, we’ll continually be<em> in</em> the struggle. If we continue with this struggle, our relationship with similar feelings or thoughts will <em>always</em> and <em>only</em> be one of resistance.
</p>
<p>
	<em>If you are <u>never</u> willing, you are <u>always</u> unwilling; always in a state of resistance …</em>
	</p>
<p>So, wherever and whenever …</p>
<p>
    <em>Take a moment to tune into yourself.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Pay attention to any striving to do things or urges to be elsewhere. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Take gentle awareness to these and tune into any inner resistance you may notice.</em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Tune in and acknowledge any tension you may be aware of.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>See if you can create a wave of non-resistance flowing through your body as you release it.</em>
</p>
<p><em>If not, simply observe this. Be curious.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Let it be, and continue to be the witness to this.	</em>
</p>
	If this is something that you would like to consider for your own self-growth, there's a guided audio track called <em>The art of allowing</em> in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triapptech.completemindfulness">the full version</a>

	This can be done by doing a quick check-in of your emotions whilst you're sitting on a train. It could be having a few moments to turn towards how you're feeling before leaving for work. Whatever the situation, it's good to tap into what's going on inside of us, in order to take responsibility for what we're feeling. And this simply involves making space for what we're carrying. 
</p>
<p>	
	The benefits of practising the art of allowing are:
</p>
<p>
	1) It provides for us a space to know how we are emotionally, <em>before</em> being made aware of our feelings when they're at a greater intensity, 
</p>
<p>	
	2) It gives us the insight to recognise that, in those moments of awareness, our emotions are just an <em>experience.</em> A feeling that doesn't have to influence our behaviour and be associated with life in the <em>external world,</em> and
</p>
<p>	
	3) In this space is the capacity to choose. The <em>choice point</em> of being under the influence of unwanted feelings or being the witness to these as they arise.
</p>
<p>
	4) The thickening of neural pathways in the brain associated to this. The more we practise, the more our brain adapts and grows for this very purpose. This helps strengthen our tendency to be able to do this for future situations.
