    Have you ever taken the opportunity to watch your own mind? 
</p>
<p> 
    It <em>is</em> possible for us to watch our own thinking. But minds don’t like it when we do this. They would rather our attention be fully absorbed with them. When we move into this space of awareness, it's a bit like looking down onto a large valley where all the different activities of the village are taking place. The mental events we experience represent all this activity. The more we practise observing our minds in this way, the easier it gets. In doing so, we get in touch with the observer within.

</p>
<p>
    In asking the question, 'What am I noticing?' in the very moment we actually do this, we make contact with the our observer. Our awareness expands to encompass the body, mind and world; we’re able to connect with our entire experience for what it is. You may remember in the <a href="../2.Intro to mindfulness/303.What is mindfulness - part two.html">What is mindfulness? - part two</a> section when I wrote about the moments that we have when we stare in awe at a sky of stars. In these moments of receptiveness, we can be said to be fully conscious or awake.

</p>
<p>
    This doesn’t involve trying to experience something in a certain way. That’s a subtle form of control as the quote above suggests. This is about simply letting things unfold. Imagine you're watching a beautiful sunset. Seconds later, a cloud begins to cover it. This is about letting that process unfold without investing in your mind's judgements of how it <em>should</em> unfold without the cloud. What’s fascinating is that when we truly connect in this way, even with the most mundane experience, it has a new dimension of freshness to it.
</p>
<p>
    This sense of a fresh experience of our ordinary activities is available to all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, where you're from, what gender you are or how old you are. This pure awareness will always be in that same form throughout your life. It never changes.

<p>
    'What am I noticing…' is a powerful tool to get in touch with the observer within. When YOU would rather not be caught up in judging, get noticing.
</p>
<p>	
    Put this little question in your tool box.
</p>
<p>
    And if you don't try and force it, sometimes, just sometimes, you'll become aware of yourself noticing.

    <strong>A bit about me and noticing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A few years ago when I was being mentored in <a href="http://www.contextualpsychology.org/act">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</a>, my mentor went through a phase of bringing everything back to the subject of noticing. Although I deeply respected him for the work he was doing, I couldn’t help but think he was taking the noticing thing a little too far. Even when I queried this, he asked, 'What are you noticing in asking about this noticing?'
</p>
<p>

</p> 
<p>
    This was a great question. What I noticed was that my mind wanted to skip that and move on to the next and more interesting part. I noticed an undercurrent of striving within me. What’s wrong with striving? Nothing. In other contexts it could be helpful, such as taking part in sports or trying to meet a deadline. However, it wasn’t helpful in this context. 
</p>
<p>
    What was helpful was coming back to noticing. I was able to see this striving as an automatic process within me. But now I now had choice over it. I could be consumed in the striving, or be the witness to this automatic process. I chose the latter to stay connected with the session. The more I noticed, the more I was in touch with myself.
</p>
<p>
    This takes practice. We sometimes only get to step back and notice for a second or two before we’re back again. Nevertheless, this is what it’s all about. Out of even seemingly 'insignificant' moments can come great significance. Through mindfulness, these moments can only lengthen.
