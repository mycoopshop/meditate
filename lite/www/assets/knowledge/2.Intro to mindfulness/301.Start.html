    Just a little note about this introductory section for mindfulness. You'll see a two-part section called <em>What is mindfulness?</em> If you swipe to the left now you'll see the first part. Give it a go now then come back to this again.

    These mini sections have been organised themeatically. They are simple introductory ideas to help you get to grips with how mindfulness can benefit you.
