    Have you ever found that when you really want to enjoy listening to a piece of music that your thoughts can get in the way? 
</p>

<p>
    Here's something to try. When I tried it, I found it to be a completely new experience of listening to music. See how it works for you.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Pick any piece of music and listen to it as you normally would for a few moments.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Now bring your attention to one particular sound, voice or instrument. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Focus intently on this one part … Can you separate this from the other sounds?</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Now shift your awareness to a different instrument, focusing intently once more. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Now experience what it is like as you shift your awareness between each instrument, alternating slowly at first, and then a little faster … </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Can you absorb two sets of sounds at the same time?</em>
</p>
<p>
    When we're not mindful, the way we listen to music can be quite automatic. This is similar to the way when we're not fully engaged with someone who's talking to us. We don't give them our full attention. The exercise above is a great way of being more engaged with the experience of listening to music.

    <em>Once there was a man who was deaf. He had been deaf all his life.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>
    He would sometimes stop and watch people stand up and go through strange gyrations. Upon questioning this, he found it was something they called dancing.
    </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>However, he still couldn’t understand why.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>To him it looked absurd—until one day, a miracle happened and he heard the music!</em>

    There are many other everyday activities that you could try. The following exercise involves placing deliberate attention on the task of eating. No distractions such as TV, books, phone, radio or talking. Pay full attention to your food using the five senses.
</p>
<p>
    <em>When you're eating, notice how the food looks by paying full attention to it: the smell, the movement of your mouth and the taste…</em>
</p>
<p>
    Remember the task is to dedicate your full attention to the experience of eating, leaving less room for mental chatter.

    What about mindful walking?
</p>
<p>
    <em>As you walk, place relaxed attention on the sensations in your body. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Notice how your feet make contact with the ground. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Observe the difference in sensations between each foot. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Notice how each ankle pivots. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Feel how your knees bend in motion.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Notice how your calf and thigh muscles contract.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Feel your toes as they strike with each stride.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Become more present as you walk. It can also include having an open awareness of your environment as well.
