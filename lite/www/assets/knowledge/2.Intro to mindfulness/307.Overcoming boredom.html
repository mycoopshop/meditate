    Bored at work. Bored at home. We can be bored anywhere. Humans have brief moments of contentment when we get what we want, but it doesn’t last. Unlike dogs, for example, we experience constant evaluations about anything and everything. When we buy into the content of these, we become absorbed in stories like: <em>This is boring</em> …, <em>It would be better if</em> … and <em>It shouldn’t be like this</em> …

    <i>Boredom is the feeling that everything is a waste of time; serenity, that nothing is.</i> - Thomas Szasz
</p>
<p>
    When we become absorbed in boredom, we fall into striving for more stimulation elsewhere. It’s advertised as being 'better than this.' Promises of the better moment in the future take us away from connecting to the real, alive and vibrant experience of now.

    There’s a common illusion here. We get hooked into believing that it’s our external world that we don't like. This sounds straightforward, right? However, it’s never the case. 
</p>
<p>
<em>
    It’s our <u>internal reaction</u> to any situation we think we don’t like, <u>never</u> the situation itself.
</em> 
</p>
<p>
    This means it’s actually the unwanted thoughts and feelings that are evoked within us that we don't like, not the actual situation. So, with regards to thoughts about boredom, what would it be like to <em>not</em> invest in these? We would be in contact with the situation, instead of our thoughts about the situation. There would be no boredom. No need for resentment. 
</p>
<p>
<em>
    To break out of the cage of boredom, take as much presence out of your surroundings as possible.
</p>
<p>
    This involves using some or all of your five senses.
</p>
<p>
    Notice the initial thoughts you have about your environment. Let them be.
</p>
<p>
    No need to provide them with energy.
</p>
<p>
    Refocus on the now.
</p>
<p>
    If necessary, label the thoughts and feelings that are hijacking your moment of now.
</p>
<p>
    And then, again, bringing deliberate attention to one of some of the five senses as you return to the here and now once more.</em>
