    As we will come to explore in this app, our minds are constantly seeking for more stimulation. That can be helpful sometimes, but it's burdensome at other times because we easily lose focus of what gives our life meaning. And if that wasn't enough, it is a constant problem-solving machine too! This includes searching for problems in all the things around us as well as our inner experiences. This is why being content with life can be a challenge. We'll come on to explore this later.

    <strong><em>The Parable of a Discontented Mind</em></strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>Said the Lord to his devotee:</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>
    'I am weary of your never-ending petitions. I shall grant you three requests. Make sure you choose them carefully because, having granted them, I shall grant you nothing more.'
    </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>The elated devotee did not hesitate:</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>'Here is my first request,' he said, 'I want my wife to die so I can marry a better woman.'</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>
    His wish was immediately granted. But when friends and relatives gathered for the funeral and began to recall the virtues of his wife, the devotee saw he had been hasty. So he asked the Lord to bring her back to life. That left him with just one petition. He was determined not to make a mistake this time, for there would be no chance to change it. He consulted widely. Some advised him to ask for immortality. But, what good was immortality, said others, if he did not have good health? And health if he had no money? And money if he had no friends? Years passed and he had still not made his choice: life or health or wealth or power or love. Finally he approached the Lord and said to him:
    </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>'Tell me what to ask for.'</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>The Lord laughed when he saw the man’s predicament, and said:</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>'Ask to be content no matter what you get.'</em>
</p>

    I like this parable because it shows how much we can suffer simply from buying into our thoughts of dissatisfaction. However, this isn’t just about being content with whatever you get. It’s not about resigning yourself to life and just accepting it. 
</p>
<p>
    We can use mindfulness in everyday life for:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Cultivating a state of acceptance to the things that absolutely cannot be changed.</em> For example, complaining about the fact that it's raining outside. Resistance and reactivity in this case is insanity!
  </li>
  <li><em>Providing us with the capacity to make changes to the things that can be changed.</em> For example, fixing something that isn't working, doing something small to improve the world we share, starting a dream project and so on.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
    This great wisdom is excellently highlighted in the serenity prayer:
</p>

    Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</i> - Reinhold Niebuhr
