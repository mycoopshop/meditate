	This is a mini meditation to use for letting go. We usually take control of our breath when it becomes the object of our attention. Noticing control - focus and control on inbreath, no control on out breath. Watching the breath without controlling it. This is a very normal thing to happen in the beginning. Let it be. Give it some time. Just keep observing without the intention of changing it. If it changes as a result, that’s fine, but don’t do it intentionally. Be aware of the breath changing. That is enough.
