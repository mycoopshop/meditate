            What about introducing a good friend to mindfulness?
        </p>
        <p>
            And you could be the guide.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a great exercise where you can practise guiding a friend, or vice versa. If you want, you could just read the following script until you’re familiar with the basics, and then close your eyes and follow the instructions accordingly. It’s also worth remembering that there are no hard and fast rules to mindfulness, so the script can vary according to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before starting this exercise, it’s helpful to know that distractions <em>will</em> come from your mind, and that's perfectly normal.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're doing this for yourself, read it slowly and take in every word.
        </p>
        <p>
            Allow yourself to do as the script says.
