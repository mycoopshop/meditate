    As we will come to explore in this app, our minds are constantly seeking for more stimulation. That can be helpful sometimes, but it's burdensome at other times because we easily lose focus of what gives our life meaning. And if that wasn't enough, it is a constant problem-solving machine too! This includes the things around us as well as our inner experiences. This is why being content can be a challenge. Because we get overly absorbed in our thoughts.

    <strong><em>The Parable of the Genie and the Monkey Mind</em></strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>One day a Genie appeared out of nowhere in front of a man who was always wanting more. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>
    'I'm aware of your never-ending petitions. I shall grant you three requests. But make sure you choose them carefully because, having granted them, I won't give you any more.'
    </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>The man was overjoyed and got straight onto it:</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>'Here is my first request,' he said, 'I want my wife to die so I can marry a better woman.'</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>
    His wish was immediately granted. But when friends and relatives gathered for the funeral and began to recall the virtues of his wife, the man had moments of fond memories of the companionship they shared. He realised he had reacted in a way that was contradictory to his true values. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>	
	So he asked the Genie to bring her back to life. That left him with just one request. He was determined not to make a mistake this time, for there would be no chance to change it. He consulted everyone that he knew. Some advised him to ask for immortality. But, what good was immortality, said others, if he did not have good health? And health if he had no money? And money if he had no friends? </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>	
	Days passed and he had still not made his choice: life or health or wealth or power or love. His monkey mind was in a constant state of comparison and dissatisfaction. Finally he approached the Genie and said to him:
    </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>'Tell me what to ask for.'</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>The Genie laughed when he saw the man’s predicament, and said:</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>'Ask to be content no matter what you get.'
	</em> 
</p>

<p>
    I like this parable because it shows how much we can suffer simply from buying into our thoughts of dissatisfaction. However, this isn’t just about being content with whatever you get. It’s not about resigning yourself to life and just accepting it. 
</p>
<p>
    We can use mindfulness in the everyday suchness of life for:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Cultivating a state of acceptance to the things that absolutely cannot be changed.</em> For example, complaining about the fact that it's raining outside. Resistance and reactivity in this case is insanity!
  </li>
  <li><em>Providing us with the capacity to make changes to the things that can be changed.</em> For example, fixing something that isn't working, doing something small to improve the world we share, starting a dream project and so on.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
    This great wisdom is excellently highlighted in the serenity prayer:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <i>
    Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</i> - Reinhold Niebuhr
</p>
<p>
	<strong>How to be content</strong>
<p>
<p>
	1) Ask yourself: 
	Is this something that is in my control?
	How helpful is it to continue to do this?
</p>
<p>	
	2)
