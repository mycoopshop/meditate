	<strong>THE FEELING GOOD TRAP - PART TWO</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="video:NO VIDEO HERE ON PURPOSE"><img src="Play_button_2.jpg" alt="Tap Me!" width="100%"></a>
</p>
<p>
   Oh dear! 
</p>
<p>
    Happiness comes and goes. In fact, it often just happens in little events that may last a few seconds throughout the day. These are the facts of life. Trying to have it all the time leads to an inevitable inner struggle.
</p>
<p>
    So, is this struggle within bad then? 
</p>
<p>
    No. 
</p>
<p>
   Inner resistance isn’t bad. As we covered in the <a href="mindfulness-section:Knowledge/2/2">Feelings as feelings</a> chapter, it’s part of the human condition. But it’s often unhelpful in our lives. It can be the driving force to behaviours and habits we would rather not be doing. This results in wasted energy being spent on things that aren't important.
</p>
<p>
   Life doesn’t always feel pleasant. It’s not possible to feel amazing <em>all</em> of the time. It dishes out situations that bring us all sorts of foreseen and unforeseen consequences. And with these come undesirable feelings. So you may be able to see how clinging on <em>tightly</em> to happiness, or any other pleasant feeling, can set us up for an inner struggle. It results in an obvious conscious, or even an incredibly subtle subconscious, inner resistance or <em>struggle</em> with the not-so-pleasant stuff when it shows up. 
</p>     
<p>
   So to summarise what we've covered in this <em>Inner resistance</em> chapter and also what we've explored in this particular section…
   </p>
   <p>
   <em>
   If we reject our feelings, we <u>resist</u> them. If we cling on tightly to chasing pleasant feelings, we resist the <u>inevitable</u> unpleasant feelings that are part of a normal life.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Either of the above results in resistance. 
</p>
<p> 
    To simplify this even further in the next section…
