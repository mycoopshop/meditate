	<strong>HOW YOUR BRAIN CHANGES WITH MINDFULNESS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="video:NO VIDEO HERE ON PURPOSE"><img src="Play_button_2.jpg" alt="Tap Me!" width="100%"></a>
</p>
<p>
	Practicing mindfulness trains our brain to change. Here are three of the many ways that the brain changes by practicing mindfulness:
</p>
<p>
	1) An <em>increase</em> in size of a part of the brain known as the <em>anterior cingulate cortex</em>. It helps regulate our focus of attention and allow for more flexibility with our thoughts, including decision making.
</p>
<p>
	2) An <em>increase</em> in areas of the <em>prefrontal lobe</em>. These are primarily responsible for functioning such as problem solving and regulating our emotions. This helps us <em>respond</em> accordingly instead of <em>react</em> mindlessly.
</p>
<p>
	3) The <em>amygdala</em> is known as our brain’s “fight or flight” centre. It’s what is responsible for our stress because it’s responsible for activating our fear and anxiety.  Studies show that the amygdala <em>decreases</em> in volume after a few weeks of mindfulness practice. It also shows a weakening of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal lobe (above) meaning we have less of a tendency to react.
</p>
<p>
   This means there's huge potential here for self-growth and change if you want it. It just takes some willingness to practice. And, for me, knowing this certainly helps with the willingness.
