<p>
Welcome to your seventh day of this micro course. Please attempt the following:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1) Today's reading</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>This will take approximately 7 minutes.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/4/1">What am I noticing?</a> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/4/2">Your paint and the canvas</a> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>2) Today's formal practice</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>Get your headphones ready.</em>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Experience/1/5">Body-Mind-World (23 mins)</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="mindfulness:Experience/2/9">The observer within - part one (optional but recommended)</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3) Today's life experiment</strong>
</p>
<p>
Consciousness can be likened to a painting. The picture itself is all the experiences we observe. These include our thoughts, beliefs, values, feelings, intuitions and more. But none of this would be possible if we didn’t have the capacity for awareness.
</p>
<p>
Our thoughts, feelings, sensations, and urges are always changing. They are not who you are. The I that observes is a continuing of consciousness that’s unchanging. It can’t be hurt or affected in any way because it simply observes. It can’t judge an experience as good or bad because judgements are thoughts.
</p>
<p>
<em>How am I going to do this? Where am I going to do this? When am I going to do this?</em> 
</p>
<p>
Remember <em>How? Where? When?</em> for any one life experiment that you choose from the list below:
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment A:</em> Get into the habit of observing. Do this by engraining this question into your mind so that it pops up and acts as a trigger to be mindful! <em>'What am I noticing?', 'What am I noticing?', 'What am I noticing?'</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment B:</em> Set 3 alarms today on your smartphone to remind you to take time out. Do this by:
</p>
<p>
- taking a moment to notice things in the external world. Become aware of yourself noticing.
</p>
<p>
- taking a moment to notice the space <em>around things</em> in the external world. Become aware of yourself noticing.
</p>
<p>
- taking a moment in your day to be the observer within you. Open yourself to all experiences. If you find your mind getting in the way, then use it to gently state the following question: <em>What am I noticing in body, mind and world?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Experiment C:</em> At any point in your day, take a moment to see if you can connect with the experience of looking out from behind your eyes. Recognise that there’s a <em>you</em> that has noticed and will continue to notice everything that life provides for you. As well as every thought, every emotion, and all your intuitions you will continue to feel. Become aware of yourself noticing.
</p>
<p><em>
You don't have to wait for a situation where you notice that you're caught up in thoughts or feelings. Play the observer of body, mind and world, whenever you remember and wherever you are.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>4) Today's questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
Choose at least one question to reflect upon from the list below:
</p>
<p>
- How do you make sense of the metaphor of the blank canvas?
</p>
<p>
- Our thoughts, feelings, sensations, and urges are always changing. What is the one thing within you that never changes?
</p>
<p>
- The observer within can't judge an experience. Thoughts are just another experience to observe. The quote <em>'Truth has nothing to do with words'</em> mean to you?
</p>
<p>
- Do you find your mind challenging this observer within you? In the moments when you do, who is noticing this?
</p>
<p>
- Having completed the <em>Body-Mind-World (23 mins)</em> guided meditation, what was the experience of using a visualisation to be the observer of your emotions? How could this skill potentially help you in everyday life?
</p>
<p>
<strong>And…</strong>
</p>
<p>
It's rare for us to step back and into the observer within. And yet this state of being is available to us whenever we choose it. Our minds will of course hijack this process again and again. That's what they're designed to do. Noticing this, at the moment it happens, and even for only a half a second, is that part of you. The you that is aware of noticing.
