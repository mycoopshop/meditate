	<strong>Want a quick start?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here are three suggestions if you want to dive straight into this awesome app:
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>For a quick start to experince mindfulness</u></em>, practise the <a href="mindfulness:Experience/1/2">Mindful Check-in (9 mins)</a> or <a href="mindfulness:Experience/1/3">Mindfulness of the Breath (11 mins)</a> with your headphones on in a quiet space. Let go of any expectations you may have and allow yourself to experience this.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>For a very brief written overview of mindfulness</u></em> take a look at the text in the <em>Welcome</em> section called <a href="mindfulness:Welcome/2">Mindfulness in a few words</a>. 
</p>
<p>	
	For a simple written overview of mindfulness go to the <a href="mindfulness:Knowledge/2/1">Mindfulness</a> pages at the beginning of the <em>Knowledge</em> section.
</p>
<p>	
	For a more comprehensive written overview of how to practice it with your eyes closed, go to the <a href="mindfulness:Experience/1/0">How to meditate</a> section. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The main menu</strong>
<p>
<img src="relaxing hammock.jpg" alt="Are You New To This?" width="100%"><p>
</p>
<p>
    You can access the complete content of the app through the white navigation bar at the bottom of this screen. You'll see five icons, one for each section: <em>Welcome</em>, <em>Experience</em>, <em>Knowledge</em>, <em>Challenge</em> and <em>More</em>.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Welcome</em>
</p>
<p>	
    You're in a part of this section now. Welcome is a simple guide on what mindfulness is, how we practise it, and some tips and tools for everyday life.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Experience</em>
</p>
<p>
    This section has the complete set of eight guided mindfulness tracks, as well as extra exercises and tools, and a live recordings section of full-length guided meditations.
</p>
<p>	
	Get your headphones ready. I suggest not using noise-cancelling headphones. Find a peaceful space and give yourself a moment of preparation before pressing play (there are no fast forward or rewind buttons for a reason!).
</p>
<p>
	<em>Knowledge</em>
</p>
<p>
    This section contains a small book called <em>Mindfulness: The Art of Being Human</em>. It provides  insights into the human mind and behaviour. We can all benefit from a little knowledge sometimes. It often helps with our willingness to practise something like this. 
</p>
<p>
	There are also summaries for each of the chapters and some helpful exercises to explore.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	<em>Challenge</em>
</p>
<p>
    Here is a choice of two options. The <em>8 Day Challenge</em> requests that you do 8 meditations in 8 days. This app has the option of doing this for either approximately 10 minutes or 20 minutes per day. There is also an <em>8 Day Micro Course</em> that you can start whenever you wish. This gives you some reading material relfections and a guided meditation every day for 8 days. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>More</em>
</p>
<p>
    This is an extras section. There are links to our online communities, a video, opportunites to sign up or review and more.
</p>
<p>
    It's important to be familiar with the <a href="mindfulness:Welcome/7">disclaimer</a> so that you can understand the context and theoretical influences of the material in this app, as well as how best to use it. It’s also advised that you familiarise yourself with the <a href="mindfulness:More/8">privacy policy and the terms and conditions</a> in the <em>More</em> section.
